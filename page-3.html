            <p>My culture obsession with the East started out in my young ages as a Pokémon fan, I quickly learned of the fact that Pokémon was actually a Japanese show, rather than an American one, quickly switching to subs over dubs in my very early years. My parents introduced me to Studio Ghibli at a young age as well, absolutely brilliant films such as Spirited Away, My Neighbor Totoro, Howl's Moving Castle (my personal favourite) and Tales from Earthsea inspired me to learn more about the art style. At the age of 12 I watched my first actual anime and started dabbling in the Japanese, although I'll be honest it never really came to anything.</p><br>

            <p>I then started getting into 'mainstream' anime, titles such as Sword Art Online and Fairy Tail peaked my interest as a younger person. Eventually I was watching anime at least once a day, also starting to get into more complicated titles like Attack on Titan, that weren't characters just beating eachother up and actually required some thinking to understand it fully. This sparked my passion for culture, that carried into my later years of high school, being the main reason I decided to go to Kenya <a href="page-2.html" style="color: white">(more info in About Me)<br><br></a> My absolute dream in life is to travel Korea, Vietnam, China and Japan one day, experiencing the diverse culture that it provides, through extensive research it seems that countryside living is a complete 180 on how people in the city live and this is something that really really interests me.</p>

            <p>Below are my favourite examples of anime I have watched and then gone on to read (manga, Japan's take on American comics) however you can find my extensive list of anime I have watched over at My Anime List, <a href="https://myanimelist.net/animelist/Jakob11" style="color: aliceblue;">Jakob11.</a></p>
